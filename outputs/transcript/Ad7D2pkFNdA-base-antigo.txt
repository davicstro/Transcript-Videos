Welcome into another episode of Tailscale Explained, I'm Alex
This is the playlist where we tell you everything you ever wanted to know about tailscale, things like subnet routers, tailscale SSH, and ACLs
In today's video, we're going to cover exit nodes
Now what is an exit node? Well, simply put, it's a way for you to route all of the traffic from your client device, like a phone or laptop, and have it exit onto the public internet via tailscale at a specific geographic point on the internet
So let's say you want to do some online banking whilst you're on holiday
And this happened to me this summer actually, I wanted to access my US bank account whilst I was in England
However, my bank decided that accessing their banking app from another country was a huge security risk
So what I did was I flipped on the exit node functionality so that my phone sent all of its traffic over tailscale as an exit node to this house here in North Carolina
Suddenly, my bank had no idea that my traffic was any different than if I was physically in this building
You might be familiar with this concept from the more traditional privacy VPNs such as MOLVAD, who we have a partnership with, by the way
These privacy VPNs are very good at making you appear as if you're in a different physical geographic location for all sorts of interesting reasons
But tailscale is about so much more than that
Yes, you can do that too and emulate that functionality with exit nodes
But tailscale is great for companies and self-hosters alike
So let's dig into exit nodes
By default, tailscale acts as an overlay network
It only routes traffic between devices running tailscale and doesn't touch your public internet traffic, such as when you visit Google or Hacker News, for example
The overlay network configuration is ideal for most people who need secure communication between sensitive devices such as company servers or home computers, but don't need or want the extra layers of encryption or latency for their public internet connection
But what about if you're on an untrusted Wi-Fi network such as a coffee shop or perhaps something at an airport? Or maybe you want to have a way to quickly test a different network's view of the world to see if it's your local DNS implementation playing up perhaps
That's where an exit node really comes in handy
Setting one up is straightforward
Many devices can be used as exit nodes ranging from a Linux system to a Windows or Mac computer to an Apple TV
Yes, really an Apple TV
If you're running a DIY firewall like OpenSense, you can even install tailscale directly there and use that single device that's presumably already on all the time in your network as an exit node and subnet router as well
Here's a card to the tailscale explain subnet router video for you
The type of device you pick as an exit node doesn't really matter too much
They're all likely going to be fast enough and bottlenecked by your internet speed at the location of the exit node itself
But my personal pick for an always on low-power device that you could ask a friend or a relative to host for you with little to no fuss might be something like an Apple TV, which consumes less than one watt in standby mode
And yes, exit node and subnet routing functionality still works in this low-power sleep state or the humble Raspberry Pi
You might also consider running tailscale on a cloud vps somewhere like Hetzner or Linnode
You can do this to use it as an easy way to pick a different geographic location for your traffic
However, it comes with a potential downside
Routine consumer-level traffic like browsing via a data center IP block, because remember you will now appear as if you're sat inside that data center, is that captures and things that aren't used to seeing that type of traffic from a commercial IP block will get a bit upset with you
So you're much more likely to get those annoying puzzles if you do this long term
On Linux, enabling exit node functionality is as simple as a tailscale set dash dash advertise exit node command on the CLI
On Mac and Windows, you can simply select to allow this node to act as an exit node from the client settings
Now you will need to manually approve each node that requests this functionality in your tailscale admin console
This only takes a couple of clicks, but if you'd like, we can set up an ACL rules automatically approve exit node requests using the auto approvers features in your ACLs
I'll put a snippet up on screen right now, and as you can see, it's just a couple of lines of code that you paste into your admin console
The auto approver of a root or exit node can be a user's full login email address, a group name, an auto group or a tag owner
Once configured, anytime you turn on exit node functionality, it will automatically approve itself onto your tailnet
One final configuration setting I'd like to touch on is the Allow LAN access setting
Enabling this will allow direct access to your local network when routing traffic through an exit node
In other words, the network the exit node is physically connected to will not be reachable by clients using this exit node unless you enable this feature
It's very much the same idea as a subnet router only with a little less fine grained control
If you'd like to be explicit about what is or is not allowed, then you should turn on subnet routing for the specific subnet ranges you're interested in instead
Now, before we get out of here, a couple of caveats
On Android, Mac OS and Windows, the exit node feature is still undergoing performance optimization as it runs in user space
If you'd like the absolute best experience, we would recommend that you use Linux
It can be as a VM or on top of that Raspberry Pi sat in one of your drawers that you swore one day, you'd find a perfectly good use case for it
Well, this may well be it
So I think that about covers exit nodes
